          <p>Barrise Griffin is a disaster and emergency preparedness and recovery expert from Nassau, The Bahamas. As a native of the Caribbean, she has witnessed first-hand how, in developing countries, people’s social and economic positions shape their lives. Therefore, Barrise sees it as her calling to help craft policies and execute plans that improve crisis response and emergency management throughout the Caribbean. She also hopes to address social and economic injustices around the Caribbean and provide sustainable solutions to these issues. As the impact of climate change is more heavily felt this is an important mission to carry out in a region that is disproportionately impacted.
          </p>

          <p>Currently twenty-five years old, she recently completed her Masters of Arts in Disasters, Adaptation & Development  with Distinction from King’s College London, UK in December of 2020. Barrise always had an interest in learning about different cultures and found learning languages as a tool to pursue her interests. She previously obtained her Bachelor of Arts in International Economics & Multilanguages (Spanish and Italian) with a minor in Political Science  in 2018 from St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York USA. This comes on the heel of earning the International Baccalaureate Diploma from The United World College of Costa Rica in 2014. In 2018 she migrated to China to learn Mandarin while volunteering as an English teacher at Hengyang Normal University in Hunan Province. </p>
       
          <p>Barrise’s mission is to make everyone aware of the importance of disaster preparedness. From her experiences studying in The Bahamas, Costa Rica, the USA, Spain and London, Barrise became a strong believer in learning through exchange, and hence loves to travel. A motivated, adventurous, inquisitive and fast-learner, Barrise’s strength lies in her diverse set of experiences and involvements, making her adaptable with strong communication skills. One day Barrise hopes to work and grow in a field where she can affect positive social and institutional change to provide sustainable solutions to the Bahamas’ emergency and disaster responses. </p>
